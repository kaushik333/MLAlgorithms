# Machine Learning Algorithms | Python

These are my codes for various Machine Learning algorithms which include K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks. 

The files [knn](./ML Algorithms/knn.py), [logistic_regression.py](./logistic_regression.py), [svm.py](./svm.py) are the class definitions of these algorithms. The files which begin with "run_" use these files to apply the algorithm on a simple Gaussian dataset. 

The [Convnet](./ConvNet) folder has each layer definition for convolutional, fully-connected, ReLU, maxpool and softmax layers. The script [cifar_convnet.py](./ConvNet/cifar_convnet.py) illustrates how to use these layers to train a Convolutional Network end to end on a subset of the CIFAR dataset.
